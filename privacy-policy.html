    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>TallyFit does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All information you enter into the app, such as custom exercises and routines, is stored locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>

    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Please do not input any sensitive or personal information (e.g., passwords, personal identification numbers) in the workout routine fields, as this information will be shared as part of the routine if shared with others.</p>
